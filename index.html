    <h1>Nicky's bio</h1>
    <p>My name is Nicky. I go to Lowell High School, and I like to read and not do homework. I like other things, but those are the two that come to mind. I also play games in my spare time. One thing I don't like is this keyboard. The enter key is too small, and so is the left shift key. I really don't know what to write beyond this.</p>
